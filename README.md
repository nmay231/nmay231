I, Noah May, am a software developer who loves solving problems, diving into new technologies, and enjoys a bit of humor here and there :wink:. I've been programming for a couple of years, starting with Python then TypeScript and--more recently--Rust, along with a spattering of C and lua mixed in. Let's look at some of the work I've done!

### Code contributions to Open Source

- [Penpa-edit](https://github.com/swaroopg92/penpa-edit) - A webapp to create and solve pencil+paper/Nikoli puzzles like Sudoku. ([commits](https://github.com/swaroopg92/penpa-edit/commits/master/?author=nmay231))
- [Mantine](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine) - A set of React component and utility libraries ([commits](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/commits/master/?author=nmay231))
- [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) - A Python TUI (Text-based User Interface) framework built for the terminal and just recently the web. It borrows (steals) many ideas from modern web development and combines them with the classic interface, the shell. ([commits](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/commits/main/?author=nmay231))
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - A Python library for manipulating in-memory structured data. ([commits](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/commits/main/?author=nmay231))
- [node-cron](https://github.com/nmay231/node-cron) - A library that can run a function in node scheduled using cron-time-syntax. ([commits](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-cron/commits/main/?author=nmay231))
- [DrawSVG](https://github.com/cduck/drawsvg) - A Python library for building svg programmatically ([commits](https://github.com/cduck/drawsvg/commits/master/?author=nmay231))
- [Baro-StorageIcons](https://github.com/Dr-Turtle/Baro-StorageIcons) - A mod for Barotrauma written in Lua ([commits](https://github.com/Dr-Turtle/Baro-StorageIcons/commits/master/?author=nmay231))
- [node-inspect-extracted](https://github.com/hildjj/node-inspect-extracted) - Node's inspect library extracted to work in client-side only codebases. Useful for stringify-ing otherwise obtuse objects. ([commits](https://github.com/hildjj/node-inspect-extracted/commits/main/?author=nmay231))
- [JsonForms](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms) - Specify HTML forms using a JSON Schema. ([commits](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/commits/master/?author=nmay231))
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) - A set of exercises to learn the Rust programming language. I found an issue while going through it :grin: ([commits](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/commits/main/?author=nmay231))

### My own projects

- [Speed-running sokoban](https://github.com/nmay231/quick-sokoban) - [Play here](https://nmay-quick-sokoban.vercel.app/)! A webapp sokoban engine built within a few days along with some puzzles by your truly! I built it to practice ideas from [The Cult of Done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJQj1uKtnus), a mindset for setting goals and, most importantly, the correct ones.
- [latgrid](https://github.com/nmay231/lattice-grid) - [Try it now](https://latgrid.vercel.app/)! The classic "I can do better" approach of a software developer. This early-beta webapp has a similar purpose to Penpa-Edit but with certain goals in mind (laid out in the repo's README).
- [nmay_wrapper](https://github.com/nmay231/nmap_wrapper) - Allows you to define a type-safe schema around the XML output of the `nmap` cli utility.

### My learning journey

- [2023 AoC](https://github.com/nmay231/everything_else/tree/master/advent-2023-rust) - Solving Advent of Code problems to build my skills in Rust.
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/nmay231/rustlings) - A set of exercises to learn the Rust programming language.
- [An XKCD mirror: xkcd-fan](https://github.com/nmay231/xkcd-fan) - A mirror of [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) comics written in vue to learn how vue works.
- [Catalyst Web Development Course](https://github.com/nmay231/Catalyst-Course) - A full stack coding bootcamp centered around the core of web dev. Includes core HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS; then switches to jQuery; and finally React for the front-end and Express.js for the backend.
